    <h2>About Muktinath</h2>
    <img src="muktinath1.jpg" style="float: left; width: 300px;"><p style="font-size: 20px;">Muktinath Temple (Chumig Gyatsa) is the symbol of the religious symbiosis between both Hindus and Buddhists. The Hindu believes that Lord Vishnu got salvation from the curse of Brinda (wife of Jalandhar) here. Therefore, he is worshipped as Muktinath (Lit. the lord of salvation). The holy shrine, which is said to have arisen on its own, is one of eight such shrines (the others include Srirangam, Sri Mushnam, Tirupati, Naimisaranyam, Thottadri, Pushkaram, and Badrinath). This Pagoda Style Muktinath Temple is also one of 108 Vaishnava shrines. Here in the early 19th century the Hindus consecrated a Vishnu temple and named is Muktinath - Lord of Liberation. Against a backdrop of incredible starkness, you can sit and stare at the south the snow-covered Annapurna range, or to the north the Tibetan plateau. 
    </p> <br>  <h3>Meaning of the word Muktinath (Mukthinath):</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">  "Muktinath" or mistakenly called "Mukthinath" word is derived from "Mukti" and "Nath". "Mukti" means "Salvation or Nirvana" and "Nath" means "God or Master". Mukti holds great significance for all spiritual people in the south Asian sub-continent. Muktinath this Sanskrit name itself has religious overtone and a sort of emotional ring to it for the devout Hindus.
